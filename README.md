# binary_search_python
Binary Search, both recursive and not, using Python 

The file **binarysearch.py** uses a recursive algorithm while the **binarysearch2.py** uses a loop. 
Both receive a sorted list/array and a target, respectively, as parameters and retreive either True if the target was found or False if not as output.
